Week 3 Password Generator

## Description
My motivation to build this password generator is to allow users to customise their passwords based on what they prefer, whether thats special characters or numbers etc. 

## Usage
1. Click the generate password 
2. A couple of pop ups come up and choose based on your preference 
3. Enter the length that you would like 
4. After questions have been answered, your password is generated into the blank box 


## Credits

The Exercises done in the bootcamp were really helpful.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
